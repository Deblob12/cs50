Memory black part used to store 0s and 1s with bits and bytes of memory

Each one has a specific index or address

\0 is the only reason C knows where strings end

initials.c

int main(void)
{
	string s = get_string("Name: ");
	char initial[4]; //when stuff is declared garbage values
	int counter = 0;

	for (int i = 0; i < strlen(name); i++)
	{
		if (isupper(s[i]))
		{
			initials[counter] = initial[i];
			counter++;
		}
	}

	initial[counter] = '\0'; //make sure to initialize even if dude doesnt have middle initial bc dont want garbage characters
}
